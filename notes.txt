 a. StringVar  =  is a tkinter variable class which holds a string value.
    It can be used to manage the value of a tkinter widget, such as a Label or Entry.


  b. Hereâ€™s a line-by-line explanation of the code:


     1. import tkinter
     --> This line imports the tkinter module, which is used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.

     2. from tkinter import *
     --> This imports all classes and functions from the tkinter module directly, allowing you to use them without prefixing them with tkinter.

     3. from tkinter import messagebox
     --> This imports the messagebox module specifically, which provides functions to create pop-up message boxes for alerts and notifications.

     4. import random
     --> This imports the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers and performing random operations.

     5. from random import shuffle
    --> This imports the shuffle function from the random module, which can randomly reorder a list.

    6.  window = Tk()
    --> This creates a new instance of the Tk class, which initializes the main application window.

    7.  window.geometry("300x300")
    --> This sets the dimensions of the window to 300 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.

    8.  window.mainloop()
    -->  This starts the Tkinter event loop, which waits for events (like button clicks or key presses) and keeps the application running until it is closed.
